<h1>Loki</h1>
<p>Hello! So over break I got a Shihtzu puppy. She is the cutest little thing, but little did we know she would turn out to be a little devil.</p>
<h3>God of Chaos</h3>
<p>We decided to name her Loki, named after the Norse God of chaos. Quite fitting, don’t you agree? Now don’t get me wrong, I love her and she is the most adorable thing ever, but believe me this dog is on crack.</p>
<p>This website is dedicated to Loki.</p>
