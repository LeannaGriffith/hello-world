<h1>Loki</h1>

<p>Hello! So over break I got a Shihtzu puppy. She is the cutest little thing, but little did we know she would turn out to be a little devil.</p>

<h2>God of Chaos</h2>

<p>We decided to name her Loki, named after the Norse God of chaos. Quite fitting, don’t you agree?

Now don’t get me wrong, I love her and she is the most adorable thing ever, but believe me this dog is on crack.

  This website is dedicated to Loki. </p>

<h2>Loki Chronicles</h2>

Here is Loki when we got her on Christmas day. 

She quite enjoyed the Christmas tree ornaments.

She is incapable of sleeping with her tongue in. 

She eats mouthfuls of sand at the beach. 

Taking a nap with your foot in your mouth is totally normal. 

After a long day of terrorizing the family, it is time for a nap.
